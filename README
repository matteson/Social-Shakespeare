This is a collection of python scripts, xml files, and figures aimed at 
analyzing social networks in Shakespearean plays.  The code is quite rough
at this time, but I wanted to do an initial commit in case it could help out
someone else.  I have intentions to come back and improve it, but then, I 
have a lot of intentions.  You can read about the product of my attentions 
at my blog: http://axiomofcats.com.

---- Prerequisites

pydot      - http://code.google.com/p/pydot/
networkx   - http://networkx.lanl.gov/
matplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/


---- Usage

The computational analysis done here is discussed in more detail at 
http://axiomofcats.com/tag/shakespeare/

Open a script.  Run it.

Shakes_social.py was used to generate the network figures
as in the figures/ directory (I did some further processing on the ones I included to make their width smaller and uniform).

act_structure.py was used to generate the the comedies vs tragedies network
density plot.  If you run as is you should get the same figure.

Both scripts have options to control elements of the display, but they are 
poorly documented (read: I was writing stream of conciousness code and not 
commenting stuff, see above about intentions).  If you're interested in the work
I encourage you to experiment with some of the parameters and see what happens.

If you have a question about the work, then please email me, drew.matteson@gmailcom. If I see interest it would definitely push me to spend more time on it.
